If you're new or are speedrunning more for fun, don't worry about this page too much. Learning the game will impact your time more than anything."]},{"l":"Mouse","p":["Having a bad mouse can hinder you in ways you may not even realize. Going from a 15 year old office mouse to even a budget but decent modern \"gaming\" mouse is a night and day difference. You'll likely see improvements in click speed and aiming consistency.","Glorious is a good high end brand with features good for click speed. Logitech make great high performance budget mice. The sensors in most modern mice are excellent, so the physical shape of the mouse will matter most for aiming, and your favorite shape could lie in any reputable brand. Wireless is also an amazing quality of life feature, and doesn't add perceivable latency.","Settings are also important. Navigate to your mouse settings in Windows, then click \"Additional Mouse Options\". Go to the \"Pointer Options\" tab. You should have \"Enhance pointer precision\" unticked. This will allow for consistency when moving your mouse, and is essential for building muscle memory. Your pointer speed should be set exactly in the middle, otherwise your cursor will occasionally skip pixels.","You can instead adjust your mouse speed by changing your mouse's DPI. You should go for a relatively low sensitivity that still allows you plenty of physical room to move your mouse. These changes may feel jarring at first, but after quickly adjusting to them, they will feel much better.","If you play the older games in full screen, you may notice your cursor moves way faster. A good solution is having a 2nd DPI option set in your mouse to compensate. Most gaming mice have software where you can set what DPI settings a button can switch between. If you want it to feel exactly the same as your desktop, use the calculator below to get a 2nd DPI value to use. ((((Positive 40 test))))"]},{"l":"Monitor","p":["Your monitor primarily affects your reaction time. Most modern displays have a small delay between receiving content and actually displaying it. It's not uncommon to find a display with 50-100ms+ of latency. 100ms might not seem like much, but with just 10 instances of you performing any action based on reaction time, you've lost a full second solely due to your display. TVs are most prone to heavy latency, and should generally be avoided. Most computer monitors are better than TVs, but can vary.","Refresh rate is a separate matter, but it still affects the overall latency of your monitor. 60Hz is the most common refresh rate in general, and in the best of circumstances is still very usable. Higher refresh rates can reduce input latency because you have less time lost between changes on screen due to it changing more often. Not only do higher refresh rates reduce latency, they also just feel better to play. Everything looks and feels smoother, and that alone improves the overall experience.","While the monitor is important, you may run into diminishing returns pretty fast. A 120Hz or 144Hz \"gaming\" monitor is a great balance between price and performance. If money is no object, very high refresh rate OLED monitors provide the lowest input latency possible with modern displays. Though more niche, higher end retro CRT monitors can provide high refresh rates, 0 latency, and make the older ND games look amazing compared to modern displays. They're mainly worth considering if you already have one, or are already interested in them."]},{"l":"Storage","p":["The type of storage your games are installed and running on can affect load times drastically over the span of a run. Hard Disk Drives (HDD), especially ones common in older laptops, can add several seconds to your run, maybe even minutes. Even some of the cheapest Solid-State Drives (SSD) can save time. Diminishing returns are quickly met when comparing moderate speed SSDs against high speed ones, with savings quickly dropping to the milliseconds and getting lost in error.","If you only have access to a HDD, navigating throughout the game before starting a run can reduce some issues."]},{"l":"Computer","p":["As long as you're using anything relatively modern, the rest of your computer's hardware shouldn't matter too much for games before Midnight in Salem. Even a budget \"gaming\" PC from 6+ years ago should be more than capable of playing this series while recording/streaming with good performance. Many laptops are very usable as well. You might find small increases in time with higher end hardware, but it's likely negligible in many cases.","With the most recent games in the 3D engine, your CPU and GPU can affect performance substantially. Thankfully, nobody runs these."]}],[{"l":"Timer","p":["The on-screen timer is a staple in speedrunning videos and live streams. Though not required, it gives you a good idea of your performance throughout. Although you can use any kind of timer, LiveSplit is the go-to. It's very customizable and has support for autosplitters. It may seem intimidating to setup, but it's very straight forward."]},{"l":"Basic Setup","p":["Head to https://livesplit.org/ and download LiveSplit. Navigate to the newly downloaded file, right click it, click \"Extract all\", then \"Extract\". You'll now have a folder that contains the program. You can put this anywhere you like. In the folder, double click \"LiveSplit\" to open it. A small black window will pop up. This is LiveSplit at its core, but it's easy to make it look much better.","First, let's go over basic settings. Right click the black window, and click \"Settings\". You can adjust the hotkeys for everything as you like. Try to find some keys you won't naturally use, and won't accidentally press. Common choices are numpad or Insert/Home/End keys.","Afterwards, enable \"Global Hotkeys\", and click OK."]},{"l":"Splits","p":["Your timer is still really short and doesn't do much besides starting and stopping. Let's fix that. Right click the timer, then click \"Edit Splits\". Here you can set the game and category you're running. Immediately you'll see LiveSplit take shape.","Now let's fill up that empty space. A \"split\" is a point you can add in your timer to represent some kind of event from the game, often things like reaching an area, or completing a puzzle. It's similar to a \"lap\" in a race. This breaks your run up into smaller segments so you can track your performance throughout different portions of the game. They can also be used to see a best theoretical time using your best times for each split.","To add splits, click the \"Insert Above/Below\" button on the left. You can name them anything you want, they don't have to match anything. You can add as many or as few as you like. Your last split in this list will be treated as your end split."]},{"l":"Autosplitters","p":["Autosplitters automate your timer for you. This allows you to focus on the game instead of timing keyboard presses to control your timer. While still in the \"Edit Splits\" menu, if an autosplitter is available for the game set, you'll see an \"Activate\" button. After clicking it, click the \"Settings\" button next to it. These control which parts of the game will automatically split for you. Start/stop is already automatic at this point.","It's important to note that the automatic splits effectively press your split hotkey when it sees you're at a certain part of the game. This means you have to ensure the amount of splits you have match the split checkboxes you ticked in the settings. If you wanted to split at 3 unique points in game, you'd enable 3 of the corresponding checkboxes, add 3 unique splits, plus your ending split.","Autosplitters should work seamlessly once they're activated. They can detect when the game is open/closed, and should start once you select a difficulty. If you're having trouble with an autosplitter, see \"Autosplitter Troubleshooting\" at the bottom of this page."]},{"l":"Layout","p":["The layout controls how your timer looks. With all other menus closed, right click the timer, and click \"Edit Layout\". Here you'll see elements of your layout. The game title, your splits, the timer, and \"Previous Segment\" by default. You can click the + icon on the left to add new elements. A popular one is \"Sum of Best\" under \"Information\", which shows your theoretical best possible time based on your historical best split times. You can configure each of these by double clicking them, or remove one by clicking it, and then clicking the - on the left.","To change the look of the general layout, click \"Layout Settings\" at the bottom left. You can change the colors, font, add a background, and more. You can spend some time experimenting with the layout to make it your own, or just keep it simple.","You can also adjust the size of the window by hovering over the edges and corners of the main timer window. Having it larger will make it look clearer in your recordings.","Just like that, you have a fully setup and fancy looking timer! Save your layout and splits by right clicking the main timer window. You can use the same layout across multiple games if you want, but splits are game and category specific. Each game and category you setup should have their own splits file. If you need to change the game/category, right click the timer, click \"Close Splits\", and edit the splits from scratch like before."]},{"l":"Extra Tips","p":["Here's some unorganized information you may find useful:","The number at the top right is your attempts.","A green colored split means it's faster than the time you got for that split in your best full run PB, red is worse, gold/rainbow means a new PB for that individual split."]},{"l":"Autosplitter FAQ"},{"l":"It isn't working","p":["Typically this is because the autosplitter lacks compatibility with your version. Many autosplitters were made only with access to the disc versions, and steam versions usually won't immediately work them. You can get support for other versions added by joining the Nancy Drew Speedrunning Discord server and asking about it in the game's appropriate channel."]},{"l":"It only partially works","p":["Partial functionality usually happens when you accidentally have two autosplitters at once, usually one from the splits menu, and one from a local file added with the layout menu. Disable/remove the extra one. If you're still experiencing inconsistency, ask about it in the Nancy Drew Speedrunning Discord server."]},{"l":"How do I use an .asl file?","p":["Right click your timer, click \"Edit Layout\", click the + at the top left, hover over \"control\", click \"Scriptable Auto Splitter\" to add it to the list. Double click it in the list, click \"Browse\" and find the .asl you downloaded. Configuration now is the same as before."]},{"l":"What is auto reset?","p":["Auto reset will automatically reset your timer at the difficulty select screen under certain circumstances. This is useful if you're resetting a lot at the start of a run. It won't activate if you already completed a run and haven't manually reset your timer, or if you got a new best split."]}],[{"l":"Older Games","p":["Old Nancy Drew games have a handful of quirks you may run in to. This page will document various of these with available workarounds."]},{"l":"No-CD Patches","p":["If you own physical copies of any Nancy Drew games 1-12, you'll likely find they require the disc inserted to start. It's not a good idea to speedrun any of these games by having the physical disc inserted due to increased loading times. There's two options to solve this:","Backup the disc to an ISO with a tool like InfraRecorder","Apply a No-CD patch","The first option is the simplest and provides a great way to store and play your games natively on Windows. The second can be more convenient due to not having to eject and mount different ISOs, instead allowing the game to immediately start. No-CD patches can easily be found on Google.","With the original Secrets Can Kill, a No-CD patch is all but required for speedrunning the game due to it requiring constant swapping between 2 discs (or ISOs) otherwise. Here's a video on how to install it:"]},{"l":"Playing in Windowed Mode","p":["Normally, speedrunning any of the Nancy Drew games in windowed mode isn't optimal due to added latency and the potential to click outside the window, which freezes the game until clicked back in. However, if you need to run them in windowed mode anyways, you'll notice that games before #16 don't have that option in the first place.","We can get around this using a program called DxWnd. It causes a lot of graphical bugs in game, but it works.","To use it, download the program from here, navigate to the file afterwards, right click it, click \"Extract all\", then \"Extract\". You'll now have a folder that contains the program. You can put it anywhere you like. Enter the folder, and double click the \"dxwnd\" file with the 3 circles icon to start it.","Navigate to your Nancy Drew game's installation folder. To do this easily, right click the game's icon on your desktop, and click \"Open file location\". Drag the game's application file into the DxWnd window. Press \"OK\" on the window that pops up. Double click your game in the main DxWnd window to start it windowed","The exact name of your game's executable can vary, but it's either \"Game\" or a simplified version of the game's title. It will have an icon like on your desktop"]},{"l":"Installation or Launch Issues","p":["It's a bit of an open secret that if you install an older Nancy Drew game without a second thought, it probably won't work. The solution is simply changing the installation path to almost anywhere else. I like to change the \"Program Files\" portion to \"Games\". It's organized and works well.","image"]}],[{"l":"Improving","p":["To improve your times, play more. But of course, there's more to it than just that."]},{"l":"Learning the Game","p":["Learning the game you're running will improve your times more than anything. Most new runners start off by following a route during a run. Learning the route will lower your times substantially since you won't have to use time to look at or think about how to apply what the route says. A cheat sheet for things like conversations can usually still be used without time loss.","If you reset your runs much, you'll likely end up more proficient in the earlier portions of your run, and weaker in the rest. Using saves to practice individual sections in isolation can greatly improve your times in a full run.","Learning smaller aspects can help push your times down to top levels. Things like optimizing your cursor placement in anticipation of your next moves, and building muscle memory to speed through movement sections without having to think or react with each click. You can learn a lot of this by watching top runs, or you can figure some out by going through the game and slowly analyzing sections yourself."]},{"l":"RNG Manipulation","p":["There are some games and categories where using RNG manipulation is all but necessary for getting a top run. This is because it can, for example, make a puzzle consistent that otherwise may be randomized. This can save anywhere from several seconds to minutes depending on the run.","To learn how to use RNG manipulation, see this page."]},{"l":"Click Speed","p":["Playing the games fast and clicking fast go hand in hand. There are many techniques to click at a decent speed.","Many players will use two fingers from their free hand to alternate clicking their left mouse button while their other hand still controls the mouse.","Some players will instead use their index and middle finger from the same hand they're moving the mouse with to alternate clicking the left mouse button faster. This is called butterfly clicking.","Some players tense up their hand in a certain way to click fast with just one finger, which is referred to as jitter clicking.","Players in other games have used techniques involving creating friction with their finger and mouse button to click at extremely high speeds, known as drag clicking. No known Nancy Drew runners do this, but it could be useful situationally."]},{"l":"Tips","p":["Here's some unorganized tips:","Holding right click to spin is usually the fastest, but in games 16-32, left clicking quickly can be faster.","In games 1-32?, most clicks are registered from letting go, not pressing down. You can hold down left click on anything, move your mouse, and regardless of what you held down on, the click is registered based on where your cursor is when you let go of left click.","If you haven't already, check out the Hardware page."]}],[{"l":"Getting Started","p":["To speedrun a Nancy Drew game, all you technically need to do is try to beat it fast. But you probably want to record and submit your run to speedrun.com. This is a basic guide on how to do that."]},{"l":"Recording with OBS","p":["Assuming you have your Nancy Drew game ready to play, now you need to be able to record a run. You can use any program to record, but we'll show you how to setup OBS since it's free and the most versatile. If you already have a recording setup you're happy with, skip to here.","Coming soon."]},{"l":"Running","p":["Before you run a game, you should look it up on speedrun.com and read the game and category rules. Checking out routes and pre-existing runs will be helpful too. Once you're ready, start recording and begin a run."]},{"l":"Submitting","p":["Once you have a run you're ready to submit, you'll need to upload it somewhere. If you livestreamed it on Twitch, you can make a highlight and use that. Otherwise, upload your recording to YouTube. It can be public or unlisted.","Now to submit the video to the speedrun.com leaderboards. Make an account there if you don't have one already, and navigate to the game and category you ran. Click \"Submit run\" and fill out the information.","That's it! Wait for your run to be verified, and you'll officially have a run on the leaderboards."]},{"l":"What's next?","p":["If you want to setup a timer for your videos, we have a guide for that. It's pretty easy. If you want tips on improvement, check this page out."]}],[{"l":"Getting the Games"},{"l":"Digital","p":["Digital versions of the games are available primarily from three storefronts:","Her Interactive","Steam","Big Fish Games","Each have their own pros and cons. The Her Interactive versions are the special/bonus editions where available, and may immediately work with more autosplitters. However, they're typically the most expensive option.","The Steam versions are relatively affordable on sales, but currently have mixed compatibility with autosplitters. They're a good option if you're already invested in a Steam library.","Big Fish Games is the cheapest option. Use code \"NEW299\" on a new account to get any game for $2.99. However, the versions from Big Fish Games may be prone to more compatibility issues with autosplitters.","Steam during sales is a good option for most."]},{"l":"Physical","p":["Physical versions may be a little less convenient, but have near perfect autosplitter compatibility, and are just kinda cool. They're available on storefronts like eBay and Amazon, but can also be found in places like thrift stores.","With physical versions, it's easy to back them up as an ISO file with a program like InfraRecorder, where you can then natively use the ISO files with Windows to play the games without the real disc inserted. Good if you want to run these games on a computer without a disc drive.","On physical releases for games 1-12, you have to have the disc inserted (or ISO mounted) to start the game. However, there are patches that remove this requirement. If you're using ISOs, this is only a necessity with the original Secrets can Kill due to needing to constantly switch discs throughout the game, whether physical or ISOs. See this page for more."]}],[{"l":"OBS Tips","p":["Here's some tips for making your OBS recordings/streams look good with ND games."]},{"l":"Displaying the Game","p":["When using a display capture to capture the older games in full screen, you'll notice you get a small box at the top left corner with a thick white border around it. You can stretch it up easily in OBS, but it'll look blurry and still have the white border.","Left click your display capture, hold CTRL and press E. To get rid of the white borders, enter \"2\" in the left, right, top, and bottom crop values.","To get it to scale properly, change \"Bounding Box Top\" to \"Scale to inner bounds\". You can change \"Alignment in Bounding Box\" to Center Left or Center Right depending on your preference, and where you'd like any other elements. This applies to any of the games.","If you'd like to make the image clearer, right click your Display Capture, hover over \"Scale Filtering\", and choose one. \"Area\" looks clean and sharp, but some may not like the harsh pixels. \"Bicubic\" is sharper than default and smoother than Area, but can add gross artifacts."]},{"l":"Audio Capture","p":["If you're recording your runs, there might be times you want to have other audio playing on your computer that you might not want in your recordings. To isolate your game's audio, right click in the \"Sources\" window, hover over \"Add\", and add \"Application Audio Capture\". Double click it, and select your game. You can now mute your desktop audio and only have the audio from your game, allowing you to listen to music, talk to someone, or anything else without it being heard in the recording. Make sure it's working each time you begin recording a run you care about. It's been known to unpredictably not capture audio, with re-selecting the game fixing it.","If you'd like, you can have more control by managing this with audio tracks. Click \"Settings\", \"Output\", \"Recording\", and here you can add more audio tracks. These allow you to record a video with several isolated audio tracks that you can record different things to. Select how many you want, apply, and close the settings. Click the 3 dots of anything in the audio mixer, then \"Advanced Audio Properties\". This is where you can assign what audio sources get recorded to what tracks. If you don't have a use for this, you don't really need to set it up. You can just manage mixing everything on 1 track."]},{"l":"LiveSplit","p":["The default size of the LiveSplit timer isn't tall enough to fill most screens, and many will stretch it in OBS to fit. A better solution is to resize the LiveSplit window to reach the top and bottom of your display by dragging the bottom right corner, making it look much clearer in OBS. If you already changed its size in OBS, right click it, hover over \"Transform\", and click \"Reset Transform\"."]}],[{"l":"RNG Manipulation","p":["Randomness can be your worst enemy in speedrunning. It can cause you to lose a run purely because of a factor that is out of your control. But what if you could control it?","In Nancy Drew games 1-32?, randomness is based on your computer's clock. This means if your computer's clock were to hypothetically freeze, every random event would now have a predictable outcome. This means you could set your computer's clock to a certain time to manipulate the outcome of random events in your favor. However, changing your computer's clock is a pain, especially if you want to do something like use the internet between runs."]},{"l":"RunAsDate","p":["This is where RunAsDate comes into play. It allows us to run a program with a specific time and date. With this, we can easily set what time and date we want, and quickly reopen the game at that set time.","Head to this site, scroll down just above the languages, and click \"Download RunAsDate\" (Not x64). Go to your downloads folder, right click the newly downloaded file, click \"Extract All\", and \"Extract\". RunAsDate will now be in its own folder, and you can put it anywhere you like.","Using RunAsDate differs depending on what version of the game you're using.
