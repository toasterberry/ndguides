# RNG Manipulation

Randomness can be your worst enemy in speedrunning. It can cause you to lose a run purely because of a factor that is out of your control. But what if you could control it?

In Nancy Drew games 1-32?, randomness is based on your computer's clock. This means if your computer's clock were to hypothetically freeze, every random event would now have the same outcome. This means you could set your computer's clock to a certain time to manipulate the outcome of random events in your favor. However, an approach like that isn't very convenient, especially if you're doing a lot of shorter runs.

# RunAsDate

This is where RunAsDate comes into play. It allows us to run a program with a specific time and date. With this, we can easily set what time we want and quickly reopen the game if needed.
