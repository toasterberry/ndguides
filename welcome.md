Welcome to NDGuides! This site serves as both an introduction to speedrunning the Nancy Drew series, as well as an up-to-date collection of relevant resources.

If you're new to speedrunning Nancy Drew games, I suggest checking out [Getting Started](/basics/getting-started.md). Otherwise, the left of the screen, or 3 lines at the top left if on mobile, will show you all pages and resources available.
