# Getting Started

To speedrun a Nancy Drew game, all you technically need to do is try to beat it fast. But you probably want to record and submit your run to [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/). This is a basic guide on how to do that.

## Recording with OBS

Assuming you have your Nancy Drew game ready to play, now you need to be able to record a run. You can use any program to record, but we'll show you how to setup OBS since it's free and the most versatile. If you already have a recording setup you're happy with, skip [to here.](/temp)

## Running

Before you run a game, you should look it up on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/) and read the game and category rules. Checking out routes and pre-existing runs will be helpful too. Once you're ready, start recording and begin a run.

## Submitting

Once you have a run you're ready to submit, you'll need to upload it somewhere. If you livestreamed it on Twitch, you can make a highlight and use that. Otherwise, upload your recording to YouTube. It can be public or unlisted.

Now to submit the video to the [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/) leaderboards. Make an account there if you don't have one already, and navigate to the game and category you ran. Click "Submit run" and fill out the information.

That's it! Wait for your run to be verified, and you'll officially have a run on the leaderboards.
